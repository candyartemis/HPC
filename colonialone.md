# Logging on to Colonial One
Colonial One is GWU's high performance computing cluster that is available to all students and faculty. For more information and some helpful youtube videos, visit the [Colonial One wiki](https://colonialone.gwu.edu/)

### Getting access
To request access, email hpchelp@gwu.edu from your GW email account, letting them know what research group you're in, and (for students) CC your advisor / PI.

After you are approved, use the command

`ssh <username>@login.colonialone.gwu.edu`

where `<username>` is your GWU Net ID, the part of your email before the @, to log in.

On your first connection to the HPC, you'll be prompted to accept the ssh keys and verify the fingerprint of ColonialOne. Every time you log in, you will be required to give your password, which is the same password you use to access your GW email account.
