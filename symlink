## Symbolic Links

A symlink is a file that points to another file like a shortcut or alias. This is very useful for if you are transferring data from your home directory to lustre, so you don't have to type `lustre/group/username` every time.

To make a symbolic link to lustre from your home directory, enter:

`ln -s /lustre/group/username ~/lustre` 

That didn't work
