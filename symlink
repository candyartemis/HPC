## Symbolic Links

A symlink is a file that points to another file like a shortcut or alias. This is very useful for if you are transferring data from your home directory to lustre, so you don't have to type `lustre/group/username` every time.

To make a symbolic link to your directory in lustre from your home directory, enter:

`ln -s /lustre/groups/groupname/username lustre` 

Then to copy a directory from your home directory to your directory in lustre, use `cp dirname/ lustre/`

*Note: If you don't have a directory with your username in lustre, you may have to create one using `mkdir`
