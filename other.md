## Other

Here are some other neat things that don't exactly fit into the previous categories:

`tmux` allows you to have mulltiple sessions that you are ssh'd into at once. Kind of like having multiple tabs on the same browser. You can keep running something on one while working on something on another.

[Github](github.md) is also a useful tool.

[Symlinks](symlink.md) can also help you do things quicker.

[Compressing files](compress.md) to make them easier to send.

[Make an alias](alias.md) so you can log in to Colonial One more easily. 

[Using BAM FILES](https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/BAM-tricks#calculate-coverage-for-each-position-of-a-bed)

[For loops in bash](forloops.md) can be useful for repeatedly executing a UNIX command.
