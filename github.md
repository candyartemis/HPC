## Git and github
Git is a version control system. It tracks changes in sets of files for working in collaborative environments and allows you to go back to previous states. Github is the web-based service. 

You can make a free account [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home), and make changes to files from your web browser, but for best results and maximum efficiency, you should also [install git on your computer](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to access from the command line. 

Github works kind of like a google doc, but not in real time. You take a copy of a file, make changes to it, and then "commit" or save your changes to the original file.

### Github Commands

`git clone <URL>` 
	pulls a repository in using its URL that you get from github
  
`git add` 
	adds a file to the thing
  
`git status` 
	shows what's different between us and the cloud
  
`git commit -m "added file to thing"` 
	commits change with a message
  
`git push` 
	syncs things on my machine to github.com
  
`git pull` 
	get of the changes
	
esc :wq is how you get out of changes.
